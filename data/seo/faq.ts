In contrast, our tool utilizes the Unicode Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols and Enclosed Alphanumerics blocks (U+1D400 to U+1D7FF and U+2460 to U+24FF). Modern operating systems already include fallback glyphs for these Unicode characters, enabling any device to render stylized gothic, script, or circled characters instantly without downloading fonts.",

        answer:
          "When a device displays a hollow rectangle or question mark (often called 'tofu'), it indicates that the device's operating system font library lacks glyph representations for that specific Unicode character block. This typically happens only on very old legacy operating systems (such as Android 5 or older). Modern iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows devices support over 99% of these Unicode glyphs natively.",

      {
        question: "Are Unicode fancy fonts accessible for screen readers and visually impaired users?",
        answer:
          "Screen readers (such as Apple VoiceOver, NVDA, and Android TalkBack) read Unicode mathematical symbols literally. For example, a word typed in Mathematical Bold Script will be read aloud as 'Mathematical Bold Script Capital H, Mathematical Bold Script Small e...'. For this reason, we recommend using fancy fonts for accents, usernames, short titles, and social bios, while keeping important accessibility-critical text and long-form body content in standard plain text.",

Popular gamer aesthetics include Kaomoji wings (e.g. ꧁༺Name༻꧂), cross-hatch strikethroughs, and tiny small-caps. If a particular game enforces strict ASCII rules for usernames, it will display a warning during name changes, but most titles support these characters.",

        question: "What is natural numeric sorting?",

        question: "Does sorting alter empty lines or spaces?",

        question: "What is the difference between reversing characters and reversing words?",
        answer:

        answer:
          "A cryptographic hash generator takes an arbitrary-length string of text, encodes it into bytes (typically UTF-8), and processes it through a deterministic mathematical hashing algorithm (such as SHA-256). The result is a fixed-size hexadecimal string known as a message digest or checksum. The process is deterministic—identical input always yields the exact same hash—yet irreversible, making it computationally infeasible under expected security assumptions to calculate the original input from the digest alone.",

        question: "Which hash algorithms are supported by this tool?",
        answer:
          "This utility natively supports SHA-256 (256-bit / 64 hex characters), SHA-384 (384-bit / 96 hex characters), SHA-512 (512-bit / 128 hex characters), and SHA-1 (160-bit / 40 hex characters) using the browser-native Web Crypto API. All four digests are computed simultaneously so you can compare multiple hashes in parallel. Legacy algorithms like MD5 are intentionally excluded because they are cryptographically broken and unsupported by the W3C Web Crypto specification.",

        question: "Is hashing the same as encryption?",
        answer:
          "No. Hashing and encryption serve completely different purposes. Hashing is a strictly one-way transformation without a key; once data is hashed, it cannot be decrypted back into its original text. Encryption is a two-way process designed to protect confidentiality, where ciphertext can be reversed back into plaintext using a secret cryptographic key (such as AES or RSA).",
      },
      {
        question: "Can a cryptographic hash like SHA-256 be reversed or decrypted?",
        answer:
          "No. Secure cryptographic hash functions possess strong pre-image resistance, making it computationally infeasible under expected security assumptions to reverse or calculate the original input text from the digest alone. The only way an attacker can attempt to identify the original input is through brute-force guessing or precomputed rainbow tables, which is why salting and computational difficulty are critical for sensitive data.",

        answer:
          "SHA-256 produces a 256-bit digest (64 hexadecimal characters) and operates on 32-bit words, making it efficient across all devices and the global standard for SSL/TLS, Git, and blockchain protocols. SHA-512 produces a 512-bit digest (128 hexadecimal characters) and operates on 64-bit words, providing higher collision resistance and often faster throughput on modern 64-bit desktop and server processors.",

        question: "How do I convert a calendar date back to a Unix timestamp?",
        answer:
          "Type or paste YYYY-MM-DD or an ISO date-time into the input box—such as an ISO 8601 string (`2026-09-30T12:00:00Z`), a standard date (`2026-09-30`), or `2026-09-30T12:00:00`. Dates without an offset use the selected timezone; an explicit Z or offset wins. Invalid calendar dates and ambiguous or nonexistent local times are rejected. The converter automatically switches to date-to-timestamp mode and outputs the equivalent epoch value in both seconds and milliseconds with one-click copy buttons.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does a Unix timestamp include timezone information?",
        answer:
          "No. A Unix timestamp is an absolute scalar quantity that measures elapsed time from a fixed reference point (1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC). It has no concept of timezones, offsets, or daylight saving rules. Timezones are applied purely at the display layer when formatting the timestamp into a human-readable calendar date.",

        question: "Can this tool convert negative or pre-1970 Unix timestamps?",

      },
      {
        question: "Is my timestamp or date input transmitted to any server?",
        answer:

        question: "Does this calculator handle leap years correctly?",
